      <p id="abt">UniqPlus Event Decor, LLC is founded by Mavis Owusu and assisted by her husband Yaw Owusu and their two girls. Mavis always has the passion to make things look beautiful and started event decorations, when their first daughter was born twenty years ago. Originally, from Ghana-West Africa, when their first daughter was born, Ghanaian tradition demands that the child is shown to friends and families in a special ceremony (Outdooring Ceremony). Mavis and Yaw wanted the outdooring ceremony to be special, and therefore rented an event hall. They additionally hired an event decorator to make the place beautiful for the occasion. After, consultation with the decorator and detailing their decoration needs, they were totally disappointed on the day of the event. The decorations fell short of their expectations, as the colors were not what was selected and the linens used were also dirty. When their second daughter was born and it was time to outdoor her, Mavis decided to do all the decorations herself with the help of her husband. She chose the right colors (white, pink, and gold) and carefully coordinated the colors and accents to make the space beautiful! All invited guests and families who attended the event were amazed and asked if Mavis had paid someone to do the decorations. After that, friends and families always asked Mavis to decorate their events such as baby showers, birthday parties, graduations etc. Mavis continued to decorate for friends and families and decorated for corporate events at work. At the end of 2019, Mavis decided to turn her passion of decorations into a business and UniqPlus Event DÃ©cor, LLC was established. Mavis is forever grateful to the Almighty God, for the talent and passion given to her to decorate events with personal touch and to put a smile on clients faces!</p>
